# Overview

Amazon GameLift is a fully managed service that lets game developers to manage and scale dedicated game servers for session-based multiplayer games. The Amazon GameLift plugin for Unity provides tools that makes it quicker and easier to set up your Unity project for hosting on Amazon GameLift. Once the plugin is installed, you can access the plugin from within the Unity editor and start using it to integrate Amazon GameLift functionality into your client and server code. The plugin contains functionality to automatically bootstrap your game runtime environment to the AWS Cloud, fully test your game server integration with Amazon GameLift locally, and deploy your game servers on Amazon GameLift. For more information about using the plugin for Unity, see the [Amazon GameLift plugin for Unity guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/unity-plug-in.html).

You can use built-in templates to deploy your game for the following common scenarios. 
* Single-region fleet: Deploy your game server to one fleet in a single AWS Region. Use this scenario to experiment with your install scripts and runtime deployment, as well as your integration.
* Spot fleet: Deploy your game server to a set of low-cost Spot fleets and a back-up On-Demand fleet. Use this scenario to experiment with a multi-fleet hosting structure that balances cost savings and durable game session availability.
* FlexMatch fleet: Deploy your game server for hosting with a FlexMatch matchmaking solution. [Amazon GameLift FlexMatch](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/flexmatchguide/match-intro.html) is a highly scalable and customizable matchmaking service for multiplayer games. Use this scenario to set up basic matchmaking components (including a rule set) that you can customize.

Each scenario uses an AWS CloudFormation template to deploy a resource stack for your game server solution. You can view and manage your resource stacks in the AWS Management Console for CloudFormation.

## Contributing to this plugin

### Prerequisites

* Administrator rights on a Microsoft Windows OS

    * You also need to add the Unity editor folder (e.g. `C:\Program Files\Unity\Hub\Editor\<version>\Editor\ `) to the Windows PATH environment variable.
* Visual Studio 2019 (can be installed with Unity)
* .NET Core 6 to build the core plugin source.
* NodeJS/npm: https://nodejs.org/en/download/ to package the plugin.

### Modifying the plugin code

1. Clone the [`amazon-gamelift-plugin-unity`](https://github.com/aws/amazon-gamelift-plugin-unity) repository from GitHub.
1. Run `Scripts~\windows\release.ps1 -Sdk <version>` in PowerShell to build the plugin and dependent libraries (only needed once).
1. In Unity Hub, create a new project.
1. Open Unity Package Manager, import project from disk, and select the `package.json` located in the plugin's root folder.
1. Setup code debugging in Unity: https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/ManagedCodeDebugging.html, and change Unity project to Debug Mode.
1. A .sln file should be created in the Unity project root, you can open that with Visual Studio.
1. Make changes to the plugin code, and Unity should recompile after each change.
1. Once changes are made, run the unit tests via `Window > General > Test Runner`.

### Packaging the plugin

Run `Scripts~\windows\release.ps1 -Sdk <version>` to clean, build, export, and package the plugin with the server SDK in a single command.

Alternatively:
1. Run `Scripts~\windows\clean.ps1` to delete all dlls and temp files (If you want to build faster, you can comment out `.clean-download-files` execution).
1. Run `Scripts~\windows\build.ps1` to build dlls and sample game.
1. Run `Scripts~\windows\export.ps1 -Sdk <version>` to export the plugin into a tarball (.tgz) and package it with the server SDK in the project root folder.

### Testing the plugin

Follow instructions in [Unity Docs](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/cus-tests.html#tests) to enable your project for testing:
1. Open the Project manifest (located at `<project>/Packages/manifest.json`).
1. Verify `com.amazonaws.gamelift` is present as a dependency.
1. Add to the bottom of the file:

````
    "testables": [ "com.amazonaws.gamelift" ]
````

After enabling testing, the project tests can be run via [Unity Test Runner](https://docs.unity3d.com/2017.4/Documentation/Manual/testing-editortestsrunner.html).
