            Container for the parameters to the AcceptMatch operation.
            Registers a player's acceptance or rejection of a proposed FlexMatch match. A matchmaking
            configuration may require player acceptance; if so, then matches built with that configuration
            cannot be completed unless all players accept the proposed match within a specified
            time limit. 
            
             
            <para>
            When FlexMatch builds a match, all the matchmaking tickets involved in the proposed
            match are placed into status <code>REQUIRES_ACCEPTANCE</code>. This is a trigger for
            your game to get acceptance from all players in the ticket. Acceptances are only valid
            for tickets when they are in this status; all other acceptances result in an error.
            </para>
             
            <para>
            To register acceptance, specify the ticket ID, a response, and one or more players.
            Once all players have registered acceptance, the matchmaking tickets advance to status
            <code>PLACING</code>, where a new game session is created for the match. 
            </para>
             
            <para>
            If any player rejects the match, or if acceptances are not received before a specified
            timeout, the proposed match is dropped. The matchmaking tickets are then handled in
            one of two ways: For tickets where one or more players rejected the match, the ticket
            status is returned to <code>SEARCHING</code> to find a new match. For tickets where
            one or more players failed to respond, the ticket status is set to <code>CANCELLED</code>,
            and processing is terminated. A new matchmaking request for these players can be submitted
            as needed.

            <para>
            Locates an available game server and temporarily reserves it to host gameplay and
            players. This operation is called from a game client or client service (such as a
            matchmaker) to request hosting resources for a new game session. In response, GameLift
            FleetIQ locates an available game server, places it in <code>CLAIMED</code> status
            for 60 seconds, and returns connection information that players can use to connect
            to the game server. 
            </para>
             
            <para>
            To claim a game server, identify a game server group. You can also specify a game
            server ID, although this approach bypasses GameLift FleetIQ placement optimization.
            Optionally, include game data to pass to the game server at the start of a game session,
            such as a game map or player information. 
            </para>
             
            <para>
            When a game server is successfully claimed, connection information is returned. A
            claimed game server's utilization status remains <code>AVAILABLE</code> while the
            claim status is set to <code>CLAIMED</code> for up to 60 seconds. This time period
            gives the game server time to update its status to <code>UTILIZED</code> (using <a>UpdateGameServer</a>)
            once players join. If the game server's status is not updated within 60 seconds, the
            game server reverts to unclaimed status and is available to be claimed by another
            request. The claim time period is a fixed value and is not configurable.
            </para>
             
            <para>
            If you try to claim a specific game server, this request will fail in the following
            cases:

             <ul> <li>

            <para>
            When claiming a specific game server, this request will succeed even if the game server

            Creates an alias for a fleet. In most situations, you can use an alias ID in place
            of a fleet ID. An alias provides a level of abstraction for a fleet that is useful
            when redirecting player traffic from one fleet to another, such as when updating your
            game build. 
            
             
            <para>
            Amazon GameLift supports two types of routing strategies for aliases: simple and terminal.
            A simple alias points to an active fleet. A terminal alias is used to display messaging
            or link to a URL instead of routing players to an active fleet. For example, you might
            use a terminal alias when a game version is no longer supported and you want to direct
            players to an upgrade site. 
            </para>
             
            <para>
            To create a fleet alias, specify an alias name, routing strategy, and optional description.
            Each simple alias can point to only one fleet, but a fleet can have multiple aliases.
            If successful, a new alias record is returned, including an alias ID and an ARN. You
            can reassign an alias to another fleet by calling <code>UpdateAlias</code>.

            To create a new game build with build files that are in an Amazon S3 location under
            an AWS account that you control. To use this option, you must first give Amazon GameLift
            access to the Amazon S3 bucket. With permissions in place, call <code>CreateBuild</code>
            and specify a build name, operating system, and the Amazon S3 storage location of
            your game build.
            </para>
             </li> <li> 
            <para>
            To directly upload your build files to a GameLift Amazon S3 location. To use this
            option, first call <code>CreateBuild</code> and specify a build name and operating
            system. This operation creates a new build resource and also returns an Amazon S3
            location with temporary access credentials. Use the credentials to manually upload
            your build files to the specified Amazon S3 location. For more information, see <a

            The operating system that the game server binaries are built to run on. This value
            determines the type of fleet resources that you can use for this build. If your game
            build contains multiple executables, they all must run on the same operating system.
            If an operating system is not specified when creating a build, Amazon GameLift uses
            the default value (WINDOWS_2012). This value cannot be changed later.

            Most GameLift fleets can deploy instances to multiple locations, including the home
            Region (where the fleet is created) and an optional set of remote locations. Fleets
            that are created in the following AWS Regions support multiple locations: us-east-1
            (N. Virginia), us-west-2 (Oregon), eu-central-1 (Frankfurt), eu-west-1 (Ireland),
            ap-southeast-2 (Sydney), ap-northeast-1 (Tokyo), and ap-northeast-2 (Seoul). Fleets
            that are created in other GameLift Regions can deploy instances in the fleet's home
            Region only. All fleet instances use the same configuration regardless of location;
            however, you can adjust capacity settings and turn auto-scaling on/off for each location.
            </para>
             
            <para>
            To create a fleet, choose the hardware for your instances, specify a game server build
            or Realtime script to deploy, and provide a runtime configuration to direct GameLift
            how to start and run game servers on each instance in the fleet. Set permissions for
            inbound traffic to your game servers, and enable optional features as needed. When
            creating a multi-location fleet, provide a list of additional remote locations.

            Once the game server group and corresponding Auto Scaling group are created, you have

            that are set when creating a game server group, including maximum/minimum size and
            auto-scaling policy settings, must be updated directly in the Auto Scaling group.
            Keep in mind that some Auto Scaling group properties are periodically updated by GameLift
            FleetIQ as part of its balancing activities to optimize for availability and cost.

            Creates a placement queue that processes requests for new game sessions. A queue uses
            FleetIQ algorithms to determine the best placement locations and find an available
            game server there, then prompts the game server process to start a new game session.
            
            
             
            <para>
            A game session queue is configured with a set of destinations (GameLift fleets or
            aliases), which determine the locations where the queue can place new game sessions.
            These destinations can span multiple fleet types (Spot and On-Demand), instance types,
            and AWS Regions. If the queue includes multi-location fleets, the queue is able to
            place game sessions in all of a fleet's remote locations. You can opt to filter out
            individual locations if needed.
            </para>
             
            <para>
            The queue configuration also determines how FleetIQ selects the best available placement
            for a new game session. Before searching for an available game server, FleetIQ first
            prioritizes the queue's destinations and locations, with the best placement locations
            on top. You can set up the queue to use the FleetIQ default prioritization or provide
            an alternate set of priorities.
            </para>
             
            <para>
            To create a new queue, provide a name, timeout value, and a list of destinations.
            Optionally, specify a sort configuration and/or a filter, and define a set of latency
            cap policies. You can also include the ARN for an Amazon Simple Notification Service
            (SNS) topic to receive notifications of game session placement activity. Notifications
            using SNS or CloudWatch events is the preferred way to track placement activity.

            to gradually relax latency requirements a step at a time. Multiple policies are applied
            based on their maximum allowed latency, starting with the lowest value.

            Defines a new matchmaking configuration for use with FlexMatch. Whether your are using
            FlexMatch with GameLift hosting or as a standalone matchmaking service, the matchmaking
            configuration sets out rules for matching players and forming teams. If you're also
            using GameLift hosting, it defines how to start game sessions for each match. Your
            matchmaking system can use multiple configurations to handle different game scenarios.
            All matchmaking requests (<a>StartMatchmaking</a> or <a>StartMatchBackfill</a>) identify
            the matchmaking configuration to use and provide player attributes consistent with
            that configuration. 
            
             
            <para>
            To create a matchmaking configuration, you must provide the following: configuration
            name and FlexMatch mode (with or without GameLift hosting); a rule set that specifies
            how to evaluate players and find acceptable matches; whether player acceptance is
            required; and the maximum time allowed for a matchmaking attempt. When using FlexMatch
            with GameLift hosting, you also need to identify the game session queue to use when
            starting a game session for the match.
            </para>
             
            <para>
            In addition, you must set up an Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) topic to
            receive matchmaking notifications. Provide the topic ARN in the matchmaking configuration.
            An alternative method, continuously polling ticket status with <a>DescribeMatchmaking</a>,
            is only suitable for games in development with low matchmaking usage.

            Creates a new script record for your Realtime Servers script. Realtime scripts are
            JavaScript that provide configuration settings and optional custom game logic for
            your game. The script is deployed when you create a Realtime Servers fleet to host

            To create a new script record, specify a script name and provide the script file(s).
            The script files and all dependencies must be zipped into a single file. You can pull

            </para>

            An Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket under your AWS account. Use the
            <i>StorageLocation</i> parameter for this option. You'll need to have an Identity
            Access Management (IAM) role that allows the Amazon GameLift service to access your
            S3 bucket.

            <para>
            If the call is successful, a new script record is created with a unique script ID.
            If the script file is provided as a local file, the file is uploaded to an Amazon
            GameLift-owned S3 bucket and the script record's storage location reflects this location.
            If the script file is provided as an S3 bucket, Amazon GameLift accesses the file
            at this storage location as needed for deployment.

            To request authorization to create a connection, call this operation from the AWS
            account with the VPC that you want to peer to your Amazon GameLift fleet. For example,
            to enable your game servers to retrieve data from a DynamoDB table, use the account
            that manages that DynamoDB resource. Identify the following values: (1) The ID of

            Establishes a VPC peering connection between a virtual private cloud (VPC) in an AWS
            account with the VPC for your Amazon GameLift fleet. VPC peering enables the game
            servers on your fleet to communicate directly with other AWS resources. You can peer
            with VPCs in any AWS account that you have access to, including the account that you
            use to manage your Amazon GameLift fleets. You cannot peer with VPCs that are in different
            Regions. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/vpc-peering.html">VPC

            with. Once the authorization for the specified VPC is issued, you have 24 hours to
            establish the connection. These two operations handle all tasks necessary to peer
            the two VPCs, including acceptance, updating routing tables, etc.

            To establish the connection, call this operation from the AWS account that is used

            <para>
            Terminates a game server group and permanently deletes the game server group record.
            You have several options for how these resources are impacted when deleting the game
            server group. Depending on the type of delete operation selected, this operation might
            affect these resources:
            </para>
             <ul> <li> 
            <para>
            The game server group
            </para>
             </li> <li> 
            <para>
            The corresponding Auto Scaling group
            </para>
             </li> <li> 
            <para>
            All game servers that are currently running in the group
            </para>
             </li> </ul> 
            <para>
            To delete a game server group, identify the game server group to delete and specify
            the type of delete operation to initiate. Game server groups can only be deleted if
            they are in <code>ACTIVE</code> or <code>ERROR</code> status.
            </para>
             
            <para>
            If the delete request is successful, a series of operations are kicked off. The game
            server group status is changed to <code>DELETE_SCHEDULED</code>, which prevents new
            game servers from being registered and stops automatic scaling activity. Once all
            game servers in the game server group are deregistered, GameLift FleetIQ can begin
            deleting resources. If any of the delete operations fail, the game server group is
            placed in <code>ERROR</code> status.
            </para>
             
            <para>
            GameLift FleetIQ emits delete events to Amazon CloudWatch.

            The GameLift service limits and current utilization for an AWS Region or location.
            Instance limits control the number of instances, per instance type, per location,
            that your AWS account can use. Learn more at <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/">Amazon
            EC2 Instance Types</a>. The information returned includes the maximum number of instances
            allowed and your account's current usage across all fleets. This information can affect
            your ability to scale your GameLift fleets. You can request a limit increase for your
            account by using the <b>Service limits</b> page in the GameLift console.
            
             
            <para>
            Instance limits differ based on whether the instances are deployed in a fleet's home
            Region or in a remote location. For remote locations, limits also differ based on
            the combination of home Region and remote location. All requests must specify an AWS
            Region (either explicitly or as your default settings). To get the limit for a remote
            location, you must also specify the location. For example, the following requests
            all return different results:

            This operation is not designed to be continually called to track matchmaking ticket
            status. This practice can cause you to exceed your API limit, which results in errors.
            Instead, as a best practice, set up an Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) to
            receive notifications, and provide the topic ARN in the matchmaking configuration.
            Continuously poling ticket status with <a>DescribeMatchmaking</a> should only be used
            for games in development with low matchmaking usage.

            To remotely access an instance, you need credentials that match the operating system

            as strings for use with a Windows Remote Desktop client. For a Linux instance, GameLift
            returns a user name and RSA private key, also as strings, for use with an SSH client.
            The private key must be saved in the proper format to a <code>.pem</code> file before
            using. If you're making this request using the AWS CLI, saving the secret can be handled
            as part of the <code>GetInstanceAccess</code> request, as shown in one of the examples
            for this operation.

            If successful, an <a>InstanceAccess</a> object is returned that contains the instance's
            IP address and a set of credentials.

            Represents a player session. Player sessions are created either for a specific game
            session, or as part of a game session placement or matchmaking request. A player session
            can represents a reserved player slot in a game session (when status is <code>RESERVED</code>)
            or actual player activity in a game session (when status is <code>ACTIVE</code>).
            A player session object, including player data, is automatically passed to a game
            session when the player connects to the game session and is validated. After the game
            session ends, player sessions information is retained for 30 days and then removed.

            Custom prioritization settings for use by a game session queue when placing new game
            sessions with available game servers. When defined, this configuration replaces the

             <ul> <li> 
            <para>
            If player latency data is included in a game session request, destinations and locations

            cost (2), then on destination list order (3), and finally on location (alphabetical)
            (4). This approach ensures that the queue's top priority is to place game sessions
            where average player latency is lowest, and--if latency is the same--where the hosting
            cost is less, etc.

            destination fleet listed. If that fleet has multiple locations, the game session is
            placed on the first location (when listed alphabetically).

            Creates or updates a scaling policy for a fleet. Scaling policies are used to automatically
            scale a fleet's hosting capacity to meet player demand. An active scaling policy instructs
            Amazon GameLift to track a fleet metric and automatically change the fleet's capacity
            when a certain threshold is reached. There are two types of scaling policies: target-based
            and rule-based. Use a target-based policy to quickly and efficiently manage fleet
            scaling; this option is the most commonly used. Use rule-based policies when you need
            to exert fine-grained control over auto-scaling. 
            
             
            <para>
            Fleets can have multiple scaling policies of each type in force at the same time;
            you can have one target-based policy, one or multiple rule-based scaling policies,
            or both. We recommend caution, however, because multiple auto-scaling policies can
            have unintended consequences.
            </para>
             
            <para>
            You can temporarily suspend all scaling policies for a fleet by calling <a>StopFleetActions</a>
            with the fleet action AUTO_SCALING. To resume scaling policies, call <a>StartFleetActions</a>
            with the same fleet action. To stop just one scaling policy--or to permanently remove
            it, you must delete the policy with <a>DeleteScalingPolicy</a>.

            <para>
            A target-based policy tracks a single metric: PercentAvailableGameSessions. This metric
            tells us how much of a fleet's hosting capacity is ready to host game sessions but
            is not currently in use. This is the fleet's buffer; it measures the additional player
            demand that the fleet could handle at current capacity. With a target-based policy,
            you set your ideal buffer size and leave it to Amazon GameLift to take whatever action
            is needed to maintain that target. 
            </para>
             
            <para>
            For example, you might choose to maintain a 10% buffer for a fleet that has the capacity
            to host 100 simultaneous game sessions. This policy tells Amazon GameLift to take
            action whenever the fleet's available capacity falls below or rises above 10 game
            sessions. Amazon GameLift will start new instances or stop unused instances in order
            to return to the 10% buffer. 
            </para>
             
            <para>
            To create or update a target-based policy, specify a fleet ID and name, and set the
            policy type to "TargetBased". Specify the metric to track (PercentAvailableGameSessions)
            and reference a <a>TargetConfiguration</a> object with your desired buffer value.
            Exclude all other parameters. On a successful request, the policy name is returned.
            The scaling policy is automatically in force as soon as it's successfully created.
            If the fleet's auto-scaling actions are temporarily suspended, the new policy will
            be in force once the fleet actions are restarted.

            <para>
            A rule-based policy tracks specified fleet metric, sets a threshold value, and specifies
            the type of action to initiate when triggered. With a rule-based policy, you can select
            from several available fleet metrics. Each policy specifies whether to scale up or
            scale down (and by how much), so you need one policy for each type of action.

            For example, a policy may make the following statement: "If the percentage of idle
            instances is greater than 20% for more than 15 minutes, then reduce the fleet capacity
            by 10%."
            </para>
             
            <para>
            A policy's rule statement has the following structure:
            </para>
             
            <para>
            If <code>[MetricName]</code> is <code>[ComparisonOperator]</code> <code>[Threshold]</code>
            for <code>[EvaluationPeriods]</code> minutes, then <code>[ScalingAdjustmentType]</code>
            to/by <code>[ScalingAdjustment]</code>.
            </para>
             
            <para>
            To implement the example, the rule statement would look like this:
            </para>
             
            <para>
            If <code>[PercentIdleInstances]</code> is <code>[GreaterThanThreshold]</code> <code>[20]</code>
            for <code>[15]</code> minutes, then <code>[PercentChangeInCapacity]</code> to/by <code>[10]</code>.
            </para>
             
            <para>
            To create or update a scaling policy, specify a unique combination of name and fleet
            ID, and set the policy type to "RuleBased". Specify the parameter values for a policy
            rule statement. On a successful request, the policy name is returned. Scaling policies
            are automatically in force as soon as they're successfully created. If the fleet's
            auto-scaling actions are temporarily suspended, the new policy will be in force once
            the fleet actions are restarted.

            <para>
            String containing the search criteria for the session search. If no filter expression

            A filter expression can contain one or multiple conditions. Each condition consists
            of the following:

             <ul> <li> 
            <para>
             <b>Operand</b> -- Name of a game session attribute. Valid values are <code>gameSessionName</code>,
            <code>gameSessionId</code>, <code>gameSessionProperties</code>, <code>maximumSessions</code>,
            <code>creationTimeMillis</code>, <code>playerSessionCount</code>, <code>hasAvailablePlayerSessions</code>.

             <b>Value</b> -- Value to be searched for. Values may be numbers, boolean values (true/false)
            or strings depending on the operand. String values are case sensitive and must be
            enclosed in single quotes. Special characters must be escaped. Boolean and string
            values can only be used with the comparators <code>=</code> and <code>&lt;&gt;</code>.
            For example, the following filter expression searches on <code>gameSessionName</code>:
            "<code>FilterExpression": "gameSessionName = 'Matt\\'s Awesome Game 1'"</code>. 
            </para>
             </li> </ul> 
            <para>
            To chain multiple conditions in a single expression, use the logical keywords <code>AND</code>,
            <code>OR</code>, and <code>NOT</code> and parentheses as needed. For example: <code>x
            AND y AND NOT z</code>, <code>NOT (x OR y)</code>.

            Places a request for a new game session in a queue (see <a>CreateGameSessionQueue</a>).
            When processing a placement request, Amazon GameLift searches for available resources
            on the queue's destinations, scanning each until it finds resources or the placement
            request times out.
            
             
            <para>
            A game session placement request can also request player sessions. When a new game
            session is successfully created, Amazon GameLift creates a player session for each
            player included in the request.
            </para>
             
            <para>
            When placing a game session, by default Amazon GameLift tries each fleet in the order
            they are listed in the queue configuration. Ideally, a queue's destinations are listed
            in preference order.
            </para>
             
            <para>
            Alternatively, when requesting a game session with players, you can also provide latency
            data for each player in relevant Regions. Latency data indicates the performance lag
            a player experiences when connected to a fleet in the Region. Amazon GameLift uses
            latency data to reorder the list of destinations to place the game session in a Region
            with minimal lag. If latency data is provided for multiple players, Amazon GameLift
            calculates each Region's average lag for all players and reorders to get the best
            game play across all players.

            Finds new players to fill open slots in currently running game sessions. The backfill
            match process is essentially identical to the process of forming new matches. Backfill
            requests use the same matchmaker that was used to make the original match, and they
            provide matchmaking data for all players currently in the game session. FlexMatch
            uses this information to select new players so that backfilled match continues to
            meet the original match requirements. 
            
             
            <para>
            When using FlexMatch with GameLift managed hosting, you can request a backfill match
            from a client service by calling this operation with a <a>GameSession</a> identifier.
            You also have the option of making backfill requests directly from your game server.
            In response to a request, FlexMatch creates player sessions for the new players, updates
            the <code>GameSession</code> resource, and sends updated matchmaking data to the game
            server. You can request a backfill match at any point after a game session is started.
            Each game session can have only one active backfill request at a time; a subsequent
            request automatically replaces the earlier request.
            </para>
             
            <para>
            When using FlexMatch as a standalone component, request a backfill match by calling
            this operation without a game session identifier. As with newly formed matches, matchmaking
            results are returned in a matchmaking event so that your game can update the game
            session that is being backfilled.
            </para>
             
            <para>
            To request a backfill match, specify a unique ticket ID, the original matchmaking
            configuration, and matchmaking data for all current players in the game session being
            backfilled. Optionally, specify the <code>GameSession</code> ARN. If successful, a
            match backfill ticket is created and returned with status set to QUEUED. Track the
            status of backfill tickets using the same method for tracking tickets for new matches.

            Uses FlexMatch to create a game match for a group of players based on custom matchmaking
            rules. With games that use GameLift managed hosting, this operation also triggers
            GameLift to find hosting resources and start a new game session for the new match.
            Each matchmaking request includes information on one or more players and specifies
            the FlexMatch matchmaker to use. When a request is for multiple players, FlexMatch
            attempts to build a match that includes all players in the request, placing them in
            the same team and finding additional players as needed to fill the match.

            Assigns a tag to a GameLift resource. AWS resource tags provide an additional management
            tool set. You can use tags to organize resources, create IAM permissions policies
            to manage access to groups of resources, customize AWS cost breakdowns, etc. This

            determines the number of game sessions and players that can be hosted based on the

            Desired capacity: Manually set the number of EC2 instances to be maintained in a fleet

            to get the maximum capacity of the fleet's EC2 instance type. Alternatively, consider
            using automatic scaling to adjust capacity based on player demand.

             </li> </ul> 
            <para>

            <para>
            To update capacity for a fleet's home Region, or if the fleet has no remote locations,

            desired capacity, GameLift initiates steps to start new instances or terminate existing
            instances in the requested fleet location. This continues until the location's active
            instance count matches the new desired instance count. You can track a fleet's current
            capacity by calling <a>DescribeFleetCapacity</a> or <a>DescribeFleetLocationCapacity</a>.
            If the requested desired instance count is higher than the instance type's limit,
            the <code>LimitExceeded</code> exception occurs.

            low latency for most players in a game session. These policies ensure that no individual
            player can be placed into a game with unreasonably high latency. Use multiple policies
            to gradually relax latency requirements a step at a time. Multiple policies are applied
            based on their maximum allowed latency, starting with the lowest value. When updating
            policies, provide a complete collection of policies.

            If successful, the fleet's runtime configuration settings are updated. Each instance

            or not replacing existing processes when they shut down. Updating a fleet's runtime
            configuration never affects existing server processes.

            <summary>
            Registers a player's acceptance or rejection of a proposed FlexMatch match. A matchmaking
            configuration may require player acceptance; if so, then matches built with that configuration
            cannot be completed unless all players accept the proposed match within a specified
            time limit. 
            
             
            <para>
            When FlexMatch builds a match, all the matchmaking tickets involved in the proposed
            match are placed into status <code>REQUIRES_ACCEPTANCE</code>. This is a trigger for
            your game to get acceptance from all players in the ticket. Acceptances are only valid
            for tickets when they are in this status; all other acceptances result in an error.
            </para>
             
            <para>
            To register acceptance, specify the ticket ID, a response, and one or more players.
            Once all players have registered acceptance, the matchmaking tickets advance to status
            <code>PLACING</code>, where a new game session is created for the match. 
            </para>
             
            <para>
            If any player rejects the match, or if acceptances are not received before a specified
            timeout, the proposed match is dropped. The matchmaking tickets are then handled in
            one of two ways: For tickets where one or more players rejected the match, the ticket
            status is returned to <code>SEARCHING</code> to find a new match. For tickets where
            one or more players failed to respond, the ticket status is set to <code>CANCELLED</code>,
            and processing is terminated. A new matchmaking request for these players can be submitted
            as needed.

            Registers a player's acceptance or rejection of a proposed FlexMatch match. A matchmaking
            configuration may require player acceptance; if so, then matches built with that configuration
            cannot be completed unless all players accept the proposed match within a specified
            time limit. 
            
             
            <para>
            When FlexMatch builds a match, all the matchmaking tickets involved in the proposed
            match are placed into status <code>REQUIRES_ACCEPTANCE</code>. This is a trigger for
            your game to get acceptance from all players in the ticket. Acceptances are only valid
            for tickets when they are in this status; all other acceptances result in an error.
            </para>
             
            <para>
            To register acceptance, specify the ticket ID, a response, and one or more players.
            Once all players have registered acceptance, the matchmaking tickets advance to status
            <code>PLACING</code>, where a new game session is created for the match. 
            </para>
             
            <para>
            If any player rejects the match, or if acceptances are not received before a specified
            timeout, the proposed match is dropped. The matchmaking tickets are then handled in
            one of two ways: For tickets where one or more players rejected the match, the ticket
            status is returned to <code>SEARCHING</code> to find a new match. For tickets where
            one or more players failed to respond, the ticket status is set to <code>CANCELLED</code>,
            and processing is terminated. A new matchmaking request for these players can be submitted
            as needed.

            <summary>
            Creates an alias for a fleet. In most situations, you can use an alias ID in place
            of a fleet ID. An alias provides a level of abstraction for a fleet that is useful
            when redirecting player traffic from one fleet to another, such as when updating your

            <para>
            Amazon GameLift supports two types of routing strategies for aliases: simple and terminal.
            A simple alias points to an active fleet. A terminal alias is used to display messaging
            or link to a URL instead of routing players to an active fleet. For example, you might
            use a terminal alias when a game version is no longer supported and you want to direct
            players to an upgrade site. 
            </para>
             
            <para>
            To create a fleet alias, specify an alias name, routing strategy, and optional description.
            Each simple alias can point to only one fleet, but a fleet can have multiple aliases.
            If successful, a new alias record is returned, including an alias ID and an ARN. You
            can reassign an alias to another fleet by calling <code>UpdateAlias</code>.

            Creates an alias for a fleet. In most situations, you can use an alias ID in place
            of a fleet ID. An alias provides a level of abstraction for a fleet that is useful
            when redirecting player traffic from one fleet to another, such as when updating your
            game build. 
            
             
            <para>
            Amazon GameLift supports two types of routing strategies for aliases: simple and terminal.
            A simple alias points to an active fleet. A terminal alias is used to display messaging
            or link to a URL instead of routing players to an active fleet. For example, you might
            use a terminal alias when a game version is no longer supported and you want to direct
            players to an upgrade site. 
            </para>
             
            <para>
            To create a fleet alias, specify an alias name, routing strategy, and optional description.
            Each simple alias can point to only one fleet, but a fleet can have multiple aliases.
            If successful, a new alias record is returned, including an alias ID and an ARN. You
            can reassign an alias to another fleet by calling <code>UpdateAlias</code>.

            ap-southeast-2 (Sydney), ap-northeast-1 (Tokyo), and ap-northeast-2 (Seoul). Fleets
            that are created in other GameLift Regions can deploy instances in the fleet's home
            Region only. All fleet instances use the same configuration regardless of location;
            however, you can adjust capacity settings and turn auto-scaling on/off for each location.

            To create a fleet, choose the hardware for your instances, specify a game server build
            or Realtime script to deploy, and provide a runtime configuration to direct GameLift
            how to start and run game servers on each instance in the fleet. Set permissions for
            inbound traffic to your game servers, and enable optional features as needed. When
            creating a multi-location fleet, provide a list of additional remote locations.

            Creates a fleet of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances to host your
            custom game server or Realtime Servers. Use this operation to configure the computing
            resources for your fleet and provide instructions for running game servers on each
            instance.
            
             
            <para>
            Most GameLift fleets can deploy instances to multiple locations, including the home
            Region (where the fleet is created) and an optional set of remote locations. Fleets
            that are created in the following AWS Regions support multiple locations: us-east-1
            (N. Virginia), us-west-2 (Oregon), eu-central-1 (Frankfurt), eu-west-1 (Ireland),
            ap-southeast-2 (Sydney), ap-northeast-1 (Tokyo), and ap-northeast-2 (Seoul). Fleets
            that are created in other GameLift Regions can deploy instances in the fleet's home
            Region only. All fleet instances use the same configuration regardless of location;
            however, you can adjust capacity settings and turn auto-scaling on/off for each location.
            </para>
             
            <para>
            To create a fleet, choose the hardware for your instances, specify a game server build
            or Realtime script to deploy, and provide a runtime configuration to direct GameLift
            how to start and run game servers on each instance in the fleet. Set permissions for
            inbound traffic to your game servers, and enable optional features as needed. When
            creating a multi-location fleet, provide a list of additional remote locations.
            </para>
             
            <para>
            If successful, this operation creates a new Fleet resource and places it in <code>NEW</code>
            status, which prompts GameLift to initiate the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/fleets-creation-workflow.html">fleet
            creation workflow</a>. You can track fleet creation by checking fleet status using
            <a>DescribeFleetAttributes</a> and <a>DescribeFleetLocationAttributes</a>/, or by
            monitoring fleet creation events using <a>DescribeFleetEvents</a>. As soon as the
            fleet status changes to <code>ACTIVE</code>, you can enable automatic scaling for
            the fleet with <a>PutScalingPolicy</a> and set capacity for the home Region with <a>UpdateFleetCapacity</a>.
            When the status of each remote location reaches <code>ACTIVE</code>, you can set capacity

            that are set when creating a game server group, including maximum/minimum size and
            auto-scaling policy settings, must be updated directly in the Auto Scaling group.
            Keep in mind that some Auto Scaling group properties are periodically updated by GameLift
            FleetIQ as part of its balancing activities to optimize for availability and cost.

            Creates a placement queue that processes requests for new game sessions. A queue uses
            FleetIQ algorithms to determine the best placement locations and find an available
            game server there, then prompts the game server process to start a new game session.
            
            
             
            <para>
            A game session queue is configured with a set of destinations (GameLift fleets or
            aliases), which determine the locations where the queue can place new game sessions.
            These destinations can span multiple fleet types (Spot and On-Demand), instance types,
            and AWS Regions. If the queue includes multi-location fleets, the queue is able to
            place game sessions in all of a fleet's remote locations. You can opt to filter out
            individual locations if needed.
            </para>
             
            <para>
            The queue configuration also determines how FleetIQ selects the best available placement
            for a new game session. Before searching for an available game server, FleetIQ first
            prioritizes the queue's destinations and locations, with the best placement locations
            on top. You can set up the queue to use the FleetIQ default prioritization or provide
            an alternate set of priorities.

            using SNS or CloudWatch events is the preferred way to track placement activity.

            Requests authorization to create or delete a peer connection between the VPC for your
            Amazon GameLift fleet and a virtual private cloud (VPC) in your AWS account. VPC peering
            enables the game servers on your fleet to communicate directly with other AWS resources.
            Once you've received authorization, call <a>CreateVpcPeeringConnection</a> to establish
            the peering connection. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/vpc-peering.html">VPC

            The GameLift service limits and current utilization for an AWS Region or location.
            Instance limits control the number of instances, per instance type, per location,
            that your AWS account can use. Learn more at <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/">Amazon
            EC2 Instance Types</a>. The information returned includes the maximum number of instances
            allowed and your account's current usage across all fleets. This information can affect
            your ability to scale your GameLift fleets. You can request a limit increase for your
            account by using the <b>Service limits</b> page in the GameLift console.

            Instance limits differ based on whether the instances are deployed in a fleet's home
            Region or in a remote location. For remote locations, limits also differ based on
            the combination of home Region and remote location. All requests must specify an AWS
            Region (either explicitly or as your default settings). To get the limit for a remote
            location, you must also specify the location. For example, the following requests
            all return different results:

            To remotely access an instance, you need credentials that match the operating system

            returns a user name and RSA private key, also as strings, for use with an SSH client.
            The private key must be saved in the proper format to a <code>.pem</code> file before
            using. If you're making this request using the AWS CLI, saving the secret can be handled

            Creates or updates a scaling policy for a fleet. Scaling policies are used to automatically
            scale a fleet's hosting capacity to meet player demand. An active scaling policy instructs
            Amazon GameLift to track a fleet metric and automatically change the fleet's capacity
            when a certain threshold is reached. There are two types of scaling policies: target-based
            and rule-based. Use a target-based policy to quickly and efficiently manage fleet
            scaling; this option is the most commonly used. Use rule-based policies when you need
            to exert fine-grained control over auto-scaling. 
            
             
            <para>
            Fleets can have multiple scaling policies of each type in force at the same time;
            you can have one target-based policy, one or multiple rule-based scaling policies,
            or both. We recommend caution, however, because multiple auto-scaling policies can
            have unintended consequences.

            You can temporarily suspend all scaling policies for a fleet by calling <a>StopFleetActions</a>
            with the fleet action AUTO_SCALING. To resume scaling policies, call <a>StartFleetActions</a>
            with the same fleet action. To stop just one scaling policy--or to permanently remove

            <para>
            A target-based policy tracks a single metric: PercentAvailableGameSessions. This metric
            tells us how much of a fleet's hosting capacity is ready to host game sessions but
            is not currently in use. This is the fleet's buffer; it measures the additional player
            demand that the fleet could handle at current capacity. With a target-based policy,
            you set your ideal buffer size and leave it to Amazon GameLift to take whatever action
            is needed to maintain that target. 
            </para>
             
            <para>
            For example, you might choose to maintain a 10% buffer for a fleet that has the capacity
            to host 100 simultaneous game sessions. This policy tells Amazon GameLift to take
            action whenever the fleet's available capacity falls below or rises above 10 game
            sessions. Amazon GameLift will start new instances or stop unused instances in order
            to return to the 10% buffer. 
            </para>
             
            <para>
            To create or update a target-based policy, specify a fleet ID and name, and set the
            policy type to "TargetBased". Specify the metric to track (PercentAvailableGameSessions)
            and reference a <a>TargetConfiguration</a> object with your desired buffer value.
            Exclude all other parameters. On a successful request, the policy name is returned.
            The scaling policy is automatically in force as soon as it's successfully created.
            If the fleet's auto-scaling actions are temporarily suspended, the new policy will
            be in force once the fleet actions are restarted.

            <para>
            A rule-based policy tracks specified fleet metric, sets a threshold value, and specifies
            the type of action to initiate when triggered. With a rule-based policy, you can select
            from several available fleet metrics. Each policy specifies whether to scale up or
            scale down (and by how much), so you need one policy for each type of action. 
            </para>
             
            <para>
            For example, a policy may make the following statement: "If the percentage of idle
            instances is greater than 20% for more than 15 minutes, then reduce the fleet capacity
            by 10%."
            </para>
             
            <para>
            A policy's rule statement has the following structure:
            </para>
             
            <para>
            If <code>[MetricName]</code> is <code>[ComparisonOperator]</code> <code>[Threshold]</code>
            for <code>[EvaluationPeriods]</code> minutes, then <code>[ScalingAdjustmentType]</code>
            to/by <code>[ScalingAdjustment]</code>.
            </para>
             
            <para>
            To implement the example, the rule statement would look like this:
            </para>
             
            <para>
            If <code>[PercentIdleInstances]</code> is <code>[GreaterThanThreshold]</code> <code>[20]</code>
            for <code>[15]</code> minutes, then <code>[PercentChangeInCapacity]</code> to/by <code>[10]</code>.
            </para>
             
            <para>
            To create or update a scaling policy, specify a unique combination of name and fleet
            ID, and set the policy type to "RuleBased". Specify the parameter values for a policy
            rule statement. On a successful request, the policy name is returned. Scaling policies
            are automatically in force as soon as they're successfully created. If the fleet's
            auto-scaling actions are temporarily suspended, the new policy will be in force once
            the fleet actions are restarted.

            Resumes certain types of activity on fleet instances that were suspended with <a>StopFleetActions</a>.
            For multi-location fleets, fleet actions are managed separately for each location.
            Currently, this operation is used to restart a fleet's auto-scaling activity.

            When processing a placement request, Amazon GameLift searches for available resources

            A game session placement request can also request player sessions. When a new game

            Alternatively, when requesting a game session with players, you can also provide latency

            latency data to reorder the list of destinations to place the game session in a Region
            with minimal lag. If latency data is provided for multiple players, Amazon GameLift
            calculates each Region's average lag for all players and reorders to get the best

            <summary>
            Finds new players to fill open slots in currently running game sessions. The backfill
            match process is essentially identical to the process of forming new matches. Backfill
            requests use the same matchmaker that was used to make the original match, and they
            provide matchmaking data for all players currently in the game session. FlexMatch
            uses this information to select new players so that backfilled match continues to
            meet the original match requirements. 
            
             
            <para>
            When using FlexMatch with GameLift managed hosting, you can request a backfill match
            from a client service by calling this operation with a <a>GameSession</a> identifier.
            You also have the option of making backfill requests directly from your game server.
            In response to a request, FlexMatch creates player sessions for the new players, updates
            the <code>GameSession</code> resource, and sends updated matchmaking data to the game
            server. You can request a backfill match at any point after a game session is started.
            Each game session can have only one active backfill request at a time; a subsequent
            request automatically replaces the earlier request.
            </para>
             
            <para>
            When using FlexMatch as a standalone component, request a backfill match by calling
            this operation without a game session identifier. As with newly formed matches, matchmaking
            results are returned in a matchmaking event so that your game can update the game
            session that is being backfilled.
            </para>
             
            <para>
            To request a backfill match, specify a unique ticket ID, the original matchmaking
            configuration, and matchmaking data for all current players in the game session being
            backfilled. Optionally, specify the <code>GameSession</code> ARN. If successful, a
            match backfill ticket is created and returned with status set to QUEUED. Track the
            status of backfill tickets using the same method for tracking tickets for new matches.

            Finds new players to fill open slots in currently running game sessions. The backfill
            match process is essentially identical to the process of forming new matches. Backfill
            requests use the same matchmaker that was used to make the original match, and they
            provide matchmaking data for all players currently in the game session. FlexMatch
            uses this information to select new players so that backfilled match continues to
            meet the original match requirements. 
            
             
            <para>
            When using FlexMatch with GameLift managed hosting, you can request a backfill match
            from a client service by calling this operation with a <a>GameSession</a> identifier.
            You also have the option of making backfill requests directly from your game server.
            In response to a request, FlexMatch creates player sessions for the new players, updates
            the <code>GameSession</code> resource, and sends updated matchmaking data to the game
            server. You can request a backfill match at any point after a game session is started.
            Each game session can have only one active backfill request at a time; a subsequent
            request automatically replaces the earlier request.
            </para>
             
            <para>
            When using FlexMatch as a standalone component, request a backfill match by calling
            this operation without a game session identifier. As with newly formed matches, matchmaking
            results are returned in a matchmaking event so that your game can update the game
            session that is being backfilled.
            </para>
             
            <para>
            To request a backfill match, specify a unique ticket ID, the original matchmaking
            configuration, and matchmaking data for all current players in the game session being
            backfilled. Optionally, specify the <code>GameSession</code> ARN. If successful, a
            match backfill ticket is created and returned with status set to QUEUED. Track the
            status of backfill tickets using the same method for tracking tickets for new matches.

            For multi-location fleets, you can set up fleet-wide auto-scaling, and then opt out
            of it for certain locations. 
            </para>
             
            <para>
            This operation can be used in the following ways: 
            </para>
             <ul> <li> 
            <para>
            To stop actions on instances in the fleet's home Region, provide a fleet ID and the
            type of actions to suspend. 
            </para>
             </li> <li> 
            <para>
            To stop actions on instances in one of the fleet's remote locations, provide a fleet
            ID, a location name, and the type of actions to suspend. 
            </para>
             </li> </ul> 
            <para>
            If successful, GameLift no longer initiates scaling events except in response to manual
            changes using <a>UpdateFleetCapacity</a>. You can view a fleet's stopped actions using
            <a>DescribeFleetAttributes</a> or <a>DescribeFleetLocationAttributes</a>. Suspended
            activity can be restarted using <a>StartFleetActions</a>.

            Updates capacity settings for a fleet. For fleets with multiple locations, use this
            operation to manage capacity settings in each location individually. Fleet capacity
            determines the number of game sessions and players that can be hosted based on the
            fleet configuration. Use this operation to set the following fleet capacity properties:
            
            
             <ul> <li> 
            <para>
            Minimum/maximum size: Set hard limits on fleet capacity. GameLift cannot set the fleet's
            capacity to a value outside of this range, whether the capacity is changed manually
            or through automatic scaling. 
            </para>

            <para>
            Desired capacity: Manually set the number of EC2 instances to be maintained in a fleet
            location. Before changing a fleet's desired capacity, you may want to call <a>DescribeEC2InstanceLimits</a>
            to get the maximum capacity of the fleet's EC2 instance type. Alternatively, consider
            using automatic scaling to adjust capacity based on player demand.
            </para>
             </li> </ul> 
            <para>
            This operation can be used in the following ways: 
            </para>
             <ul> <li> 
            <para>
            To update capacity for a fleet's home Region, or if the fleet has no remote locations,
            omit the <code>Location</code> parameter. The fleet must be in <code>ACTIVE</code>
            status. 
            </para>
             </li> <li>

            To update capacity for a fleet's remote location, include the <code>Location</code>

            </para>
             </li> </ul> 
            <para>
            If successful, capacity settings are updated immediately. In response a change in
            desired capacity, GameLift initiates steps to start new instances or terminate existing
            instances in the requested fleet location. This continues until the location's active
            instance count matches the new desired instance count. You can track a fleet's current
            capacity by calling <a>DescribeFleetCapacity</a> or <a>DescribeFleetLocationCapacity</a>.
            If the requested desired instance count is higher than the instance type's limit,
            the <code>LimitExceeded</code> exception occurs.

            Updates the current runtime configuration for the specified fleet, which tells GameLift
            how to launch server processes on all instances in the fleet. You can update a fleet's
            runtime configuration at any time after the fleet is created; it does not need to
            be in <code>ACTIVE</code> status.

            If successful, the fleet's runtime configuration settings are updated. Each instance
            in the fleet regularly checks for and retrieves updated runtime configurations. Instances
            immediately begin complying with the new configuration by launching new server processes
            or not replacing existing processes when they shut down. Updating a fleet's runtime
            configuration never affects existing server processes.

            Registers a player's acceptance or rejection of a proposed FlexMatch match. A matchmaking
            configuration may require player acceptance; if so, then matches built with that configuration
            cannot be completed unless all players accept the proposed match within a specified
            time limit. 
            
             
            <para>
            When FlexMatch builds a match, all the matchmaking tickets involved in the proposed
            match are placed into status <code>REQUIRES_ACCEPTANCE</code>. This is a trigger for
            your game to get acceptance from all players in the ticket. Acceptances are only valid
            for tickets when they are in this status; all other acceptances result in an error.
            </para>
             
            <para>
            To register acceptance, specify the ticket ID, a response, and one or more players.
            Once all players have registered acceptance, the matchmaking tickets advance to status
            <code>PLACING</code>, where a new game session is created for the match. 
            </para>
             
            <para>
            If any player rejects the match, or if acceptances are not received before a specified
            timeout, the proposed match is dropped. The matchmaking tickets are then handled in
            one of two ways: For tickets where one or more players rejected the match, the ticket
            status is returned to <code>SEARCHING</code> to find a new match. For tickets where
            one or more players failed to respond, the ticket status is set to <code>CANCELLED</code>,
            and processing is terminated. A new matchmaking request for these players can be submitted

            Creates an alias for a fleet. In most situations, you can use an alias ID in place

            when redirecting player traffic from one fleet to another, such as when updating your

            Amazon GameLift supports two types of routing strategies for aliases: simple and terminal.
            A simple alias points to an active fleet. A terminal alias is used to display messaging
            or link to a URL instead of routing players to an active fleet. For example, you might
            use a terminal alias when a game version is no longer supported and you want to direct

            Creates a fleet of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances to host your
            custom game server or Realtime Servers. Use this operation to configure the computing
            resources for your fleet and provide instructions for running game servers on each
            instance.
            
             
            <para>
            Most GameLift fleets can deploy instances to multiple locations, including the home
            Region (where the fleet is created) and an optional set of remote locations. Fleets
            that are created in the following AWS Regions support multiple locations: us-east-1
            (N. Virginia), us-west-2 (Oregon), eu-central-1 (Frankfurt), eu-west-1 (Ireland),
            ap-southeast-2 (Sydney), ap-northeast-1 (Tokyo), and ap-northeast-2 (Seoul). Fleets
            that are created in other GameLift Regions can deploy instances in the fleet's home
            Region only. All fleet instances use the same configuration regardless of location;
            however, you can adjust capacity settings and turn auto-scaling on/off for each location.
            </para>
             
            <para>
            To create a fleet, choose the hardware for your instances, specify a game server build
            or Realtime script to deploy, and provide a runtime configuration to direct GameLift
            how to start and run game servers on each instance in the fleet. Set permissions for
            inbound traffic to your game servers, and enable optional features as needed. When
            creating a multi-location fleet, provide a list of additional remote locations.

            (see <a>CreateFleet</a> for the complete list) and were created after the feature
            was released in March 2021.

            If successful, this operation returns the list of added locations with their status
            set to <code>NEW</code>. GameLift initiates the process of starting an instance in
            each added location. You can track the status of each new location by monitoring location
            creation events using <a>DescribeFleetEvents</a>. Alternatively, you can poll location
            status by calling <a>DescribeFleetLocationAttributes</a>. After a location status
            becomes <code>ACTIVE</code>, you can adjust the location's capacity as needed with
            <a>UpdateFleetCapacity</a>.

            Defines a new matchmaking configuration for use with FlexMatch. Whether your are using
            FlexMatch with GameLift hosting or as a standalone matchmaking service, the matchmaking
            configuration sets out rules for matching players and forming teams. If you're also
            using GameLift hosting, it defines how to start game sessions for each match. Your
            matchmaking system can use multiple configurations to handle different game scenarios.
            All matchmaking requests (<a>StartMatchmaking</a> or <a>StartMatchBackfill</a>) identify
            the matchmaking configuration to use and provide player attributes consistent with

            <para>
            To create a matchmaking configuration, you must provide the following: configuration
            name and FlexMatch mode (with or without GameLift hosting); a rule set that specifies
            how to evaluate players and find acceptable matches; whether player acceptance is
            required; and the maximum time allowed for a matchmaking attempt. When using FlexMatch
            with GameLift hosting, you also need to identify the game session queue to use when
            starting a game session for the match.

            The GameLift service limits and current utilization for an AWS Region or location.
            Instance limits control the number of instances, per instance type, per location,
            that your AWS account can use. Learn more at <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/">Amazon
            EC2 Instance Types</a>. The information returned includes the maximum number of instances
            allowed and your account's current usage across all fleets. This information can affect
            your ability to scale your GameLift fleets. You can request a limit increase for your
            account by using the <b>Service limits</b> page in the GameLift console.
            
             
            <para>
            Instance limits differ based on whether the instances are deployed in a fleet's home
            Region or in a remote location. For remote locations, limits also differ based on
            the combination of home Region and remote location. All requests must specify an AWS
            Region (either explicitly or as your default settings). To get the limit for a remote
            location, you must also specify the location. For example, the following requests
            all return different results:

            Requests remote access to a fleet instance. Remote access is useful for debugging,
            gathering benchmarking data, or observing activity in real time. 
            
             
            <para>
            To remotely access an instance, you need credentials that match the operating system
            of the instance. For a Windows instance, GameLift returns a user name and password
            as strings for use with a Windows Remote Desktop client. For a Linux instance, GameLift
            returns a user name and RSA private key, also as strings, for use with an SSH client.
            The private key must be saved in the proper format to a <code>.pem</code> file before
            using. If you're making this request using the AWS CLI, saving the secret can be handled
            as part of the <code>GetInstanceAccess</code> request, as shown in one of the examples
            for this operation.

            Requests remote access to a fleet instance. Remote access is useful for debugging,
            gathering benchmarking data, or observing activity in real time. 
            
             
            <para>
            To remotely access an instance, you need credentials that match the operating system
            of the instance. For a Windows instance, GameLift returns a user name and password
            as strings for use with a Windows Remote Desktop client. For a Linux instance, GameLift
            returns a user name and RSA private key, also as strings, for use with an SSH client.
            The private key must be saved in the proper format to a <code>.pem</code> file before
            using. If you're making this request using the AWS CLI, saving the secret can be handled
            as part of the <code>GetInstanceAccess</code> request, as shown in one of the examples
            for this operation.

            <para>
            To request access to a specific instance, specify the IDs of both the instance and
            the fleet it belongs to. You can retrieve a fleet's instance IDs by calling <a>DescribeInstances</a>.
            If successful, an <a>InstanceAccess</a> object is returned that contains the instance's
            IP address and a set of credentials.

            <summary>
            Creates or updates a scaling policy for a fleet. Scaling policies are used to automatically
            scale a fleet's hosting capacity to meet player demand. An active scaling policy instructs
            Amazon GameLift to track a fleet metric and automatically change the fleet's capacity
            when a certain threshold is reached. There are two types of scaling policies: target-based
            and rule-based. Use a target-based policy to quickly and efficiently manage fleet
            scaling; this option is the most commonly used. Use rule-based policies when you need
            to exert fine-grained control over auto-scaling. 
            
             
            <para>
            Fleets can have multiple scaling policies of each type in force at the same time;
            you can have one target-based policy, one or multiple rule-based scaling policies,
            or both. We recommend caution, however, because multiple auto-scaling policies can
            have unintended consequences.
            </para>
             
            <para>
            You can temporarily suspend all scaling policies for a fleet by calling <a>StopFleetActions</a>
            with the fleet action AUTO_SCALING. To resume scaling policies, call <a>StartFleetActions</a>
            with the same fleet action. To stop just one scaling policy--or to permanently remove
            it, you must delete the policy with <a>DeleteScalingPolicy</a>.

            </para>
             
            <para>
            A target-based policy tracks a single metric: PercentAvailableGameSessions. This metric
            tells us how much of a fleet's hosting capacity is ready to host game sessions but
            is not currently in use. This is the fleet's buffer; it measures the additional player
            demand that the fleet could handle at current capacity. With a target-based policy,
            you set your ideal buffer size and leave it to Amazon GameLift to take whatever action
            is needed to maintain that target. 
            </para>
             
            <para>
            For example, you might choose to maintain a 10% buffer for a fleet that has the capacity
            to host 100 simultaneous game sessions. This policy tells Amazon GameLift to take
            action whenever the fleet's available capacity falls below or rises above 10 game
            sessions. Amazon GameLift will start new instances or stop unused instances in order
            to return to the 10% buffer. 
            </para>
             
            <para>
            To create or update a target-based policy, specify a fleet ID and name, and set the
            policy type to "TargetBased". Specify the metric to track (PercentAvailableGameSessions)
            and reference a <a>TargetConfiguration</a> object with your desired buffer value.
            Exclude all other parameters. On a successful request, the policy name is returned.
            The scaling policy is automatically in force as soon as it's successfully created.
            If the fleet's auto-scaling actions are temporarily suspended, the new policy will
            be in force once the fleet actions are restarted.
            </para>
             
            <para>
             <b>Rule-based policy</b> 
            </para>
             
            <para>
            A rule-based policy tracks specified fleet metric, sets a threshold value, and specifies
            the type of action to initiate when triggered. With a rule-based policy, you can select
            from several available fleet metrics. Each policy specifies whether to scale up or
            scale down (and by how much), so you need one policy for each type of action. 
            </para>
             
            <para>
            For example, a policy may make the following statement: "If the percentage of idle
            instances is greater than 20% for more than 15 minutes, then reduce the fleet capacity
            by 10%."
            </para>
             
            <para>
            A policy's rule statement has the following structure:
            </para>
             
            <para>
            If <code>[MetricName]</code> is <code>[ComparisonOperator]</code> <code>[Threshold]</code>
            for <code>[EvaluationPeriods]</code> minutes, then <code>[ScalingAdjustmentType]</code>
            to/by <code>[ScalingAdjustment]</code>.
            </para>
             
            <para>
            To implement the example, the rule statement would look like this:
            </para>
             
            <para>
            If <code>[PercentIdleInstances]</code> is <code>[GreaterThanThreshold]</code> <code>[20]</code>
            for <code>[15]</code> minutes, then <code>[PercentChangeInCapacity]</code> to/by <code>[10]</code>.
            </para>
             
            <para>
            To create or update a scaling policy, specify a unique combination of name and fleet
            ID, and set the policy type to "RuleBased". Specify the parameter values for a policy
            rule statement. On a successful request, the policy name is returned. Scaling policies
            are automatically in force as soon as they're successfully created. If the fleet's
            auto-scaling actions are temporarily suspended, the new policy will be in force once
            the fleet actions are restarted.

            Creates or updates a scaling policy for a fleet. Scaling policies are used to automatically
            scale a fleet's hosting capacity to meet player demand. An active scaling policy instructs
            Amazon GameLift to track a fleet metric and automatically change the fleet's capacity
            when a certain threshold is reached. There are two types of scaling policies: target-based
            and rule-based. Use a target-based policy to quickly and efficiently manage fleet
            scaling; this option is the most commonly used. Use rule-based policies when you need
            to exert fine-grained control over auto-scaling. 
            
             
            <para>
            Fleets can have multiple scaling policies of each type in force at the same time;
            you can have one target-based policy, one or multiple rule-based scaling policies,
            or both. We recommend caution, however, because multiple auto-scaling policies can
            have unintended consequences.
            </para>
             
            <para>
            You can temporarily suspend all scaling policies for a fleet by calling <a>StopFleetActions</a>
            with the fleet action AUTO_SCALING. To resume scaling policies, call <a>StartFleetActions</a>
            with the same fleet action. To stop just one scaling policy--or to permanently remove
            it, you must delete the policy with <a>DeleteScalingPolicy</a>.

             <b>Target-based policy</b> 
            </para>
             
            <para>
            A target-based policy tracks a single metric: PercentAvailableGameSessions. This metric
            tells us how much of a fleet's hosting capacity is ready to host game sessions but
            is not currently in use. This is the fleet's buffer; it measures the additional player
            demand that the fleet could handle at current capacity. With a target-based policy,
            you set your ideal buffer size and leave it to Amazon GameLift to take whatever action
            is needed to maintain that target. 
            </para>
             
            <para>
            For example, you might choose to maintain a 10% buffer for a fleet that has the capacity
            to host 100 simultaneous game sessions. This policy tells Amazon GameLift to take
            action whenever the fleet's available capacity falls below or rises above 10 game
            sessions. Amazon GameLift will start new instances or stop unused instances in order
            to return to the 10% buffer. 
            </para>
             
            <para>
            To create or update a target-based policy, specify a fleet ID and name, and set the
            policy type to "TargetBased". Specify the metric to track (PercentAvailableGameSessions)
            and reference a <a>TargetConfiguration</a> object with your desired buffer value.
            Exclude all other parameters. On a successful request, the policy name is returned.
            The scaling policy is automatically in force as soon as it's successfully created.
            If the fleet's auto-scaling actions are temporarily suspended, the new policy will
            be in force once the fleet actions are restarted.
            </para>
             
            <para>
             <b>Rule-based policy</b> 
            </para>
             
            <para>
            A rule-based policy tracks specified fleet metric, sets a threshold value, and specifies
            the type of action to initiate when triggered. With a rule-based policy, you can select
            from several available fleet metrics. Each policy specifies whether to scale up or
            scale down (and by how much), so you need one policy for each type of action. 
            </para>
             
            <para>
            For example, a policy may make the following statement: "If the percentage of idle
            instances is greater than 20% for more than 15 minutes, then reduce the fleet capacity
            by 10%."
            </para>
             
            <para>
            A policy's rule statement has the following structure:
            </para>
             
            <para>
            If <code>[MetricName]</code> is <code>[ComparisonOperator]</code> <code>[Threshold]</code>
            for <code>[EvaluationPeriods]</code> minutes, then <code>[ScalingAdjustmentType]</code>
            to/by <code>[ScalingAdjustment]</code>.
            </para>
             
            <para>
            To implement the example, the rule statement would look like this:
            </para>
             
            <para>
            If <code>[PercentIdleInstances]</code> is <code>[GreaterThanThreshold]</code> <code>[20]</code>
            for <code>[15]</code> minutes, then <code>[PercentChangeInCapacity]</code> to/by <code>[10]</code>.
            </para>
             
            <para>
            To create or update a scaling policy, specify a unique combination of name and fleet
            ID, and set the policy type to "RuleBased". Specify the parameter values for a policy
            rule statement. On a successful request, the policy name is returned. Scaling policies
            are automatically in force as soon as they're successfully created. If the fleet's
            auto-scaling actions are temporarily suspended, the new policy will be in force once
            the fleet actions are restarted.

            Alternatively, when requesting a game session with players, you can also provide latency

            latency data to reorder the list of destinations to place the game session in a Region
            with minimal lag. If latency data is provided for multiple players, Amazon GameLift

            Updates capacity settings for a fleet. For fleets with multiple locations, use this
            operation to manage capacity settings in each location individually. Fleet capacity
            determines the number of game sessions and players that can be hosted based on the
            fleet configuration. Use this operation to set the following fleet capacity properties:
            
            
             <ul> <li> 
            <para>

            or through automatic scaling.

            <para>
            Desired capacity: Manually set the number of EC2 instances to be maintained in a fleet
            location. Before changing a fleet's desired capacity, you may want to call <a>DescribeEC2InstanceLimits</a>
            to get the maximum capacity of the fleet's EC2 instance type. Alternatively, consider
            using automatic scaling to adjust capacity based on player demand.
            </para>
             </li> </ul> 
            <para>
            This operation can be used in the following ways: 
            </para>
             <ul> <li> 
            <para>
            To update capacity for a fleet's home Region, or if the fleet has no remote locations,
            omit the <code>Location</code> parameter. The fleet must be in <code>ACTIVE</code>
            status. 
            </para>
             </li> <li> 
            <para>
            To update capacity for a fleet's remote location, include the <code>Location</code>

            status.
            </para>
             </li> </ul> 
            <para>
            If successful, capacity settings are updated immediately. In response a change in
            desired capacity, GameLift initiates steps to start new instances or terminate existing
            instances in the requested fleet location. This continues until the location's active
            instance count matches the new desired instance count. You can track a fleet's current
            capacity by calling <a>DescribeFleetCapacity</a> or <a>DescribeFleetLocationCapacity</a>.
            If the requested desired instance count is higher than the instance type's limit,
            the <code>LimitExceeded</code> exception occurs.
